# tokenizer.py
#
# A simple symbol recognizer using PLY (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)
#
# To run this sample, you will need have 'PLY' installed. Please see the README
# file (in the Files browser)
#

# Use Case: Enter a line of text, and for each symbol, is printed- whether
# it is a Digit/Number, a Lower Case letter or an Upper Case letter, or Other
#
# Actually the use case only makes use of 'lex.py' i.e the lexer part of the
# package

          'LOWERCASELETTER',

# Regular Expressions for the tokens
t_DIGIT = r'\d+'

t_OTHER = r'[^0-9^a-z^A-Z]'

# Build the lexer
lex.lex()

# Error handling rule
# We really do not need error handling here. In this trivial case, we have
# accounted for all the undesired characters in the OTHER category
# Ignore the warning..
# For details: Please see the Ply documentation

# Process input and tokenize
while 1:

    # Extract each symbol and feed it into the character
